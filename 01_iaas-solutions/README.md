# Implement infrastructure as a service (IaaS) solutions

## Provision Virtual Machines (VMs)
With Azure VM, Microsoft offers a virtual computer with both Linux and Windows operating systems, without buying and maintaining the physical hardware.Typically, you choose a VM when you need more control over the computing environment than the other choices (e.g. Azure App Service) offer.

### Basic components for crating an Azure VM:
- **Availability:** Provides a Service Level Agreements (SLA) of 99,9% with a Premium Storage.
- **VM size:** Determining the sizing of the VM based on running workload on it. [There are several VM sizes for different scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes). The size of the VM determines the capacity of the CPU, RAM, etc., and also affects the price of the VM. If you stop and deallocate the VM, then you can change the size of the VM.
- **VM limits:** Each subscription has a limit of 20 VMs per region, [but this can be increased on request via the Azure support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests).
- **VM image:** Choose an image from Azure Marketplace or bring your own image for creating a VM. You can lis all available VM images in Azure via _az command list --all_. [The List of popular images in Azure Marketplace] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/cli-ps-findimage#list-popular-images)
- **VM disks:** Here are 2 components to be considerd:
  - **Disk types:**:
    - **Standard disks:** HDD disks, which delivers cost-effective storage and are ideal for a dev and test workload.
    - **Premium disks:** SSD disks, which provides high-performance, low-latency disk and are ideal for VMs running production workload.
  - **Dsik stoarge options:**
    - **Managed disks:** Recommended disk storage and they are managed by Azure. You specify the size of the disk, which can be up to 4 TB, and Azure creates and manages both the disk and the storage. You don't have to worry about storage account limits, which makes managed disks easier to scale out than unmanaged disks.
    - **Unmanaged disks:** Youâ€™re responsible for the storage accounts that hold the virtual hard disks (VHDs) that correspond to your VM disks. You pay the storage account rates for the amount of space you use. A single storage account has a fixed-rate limit of 20,000 I/O operations per second. This means that a storage account is capable of supporting 40 standard VHDs at full utilization. If you need to scale out with more disks, then you'll need more storage accounts, which can get complicated.

### Azure VM availability options
There are basicly 3 types of availabillty options for ensuring the availability of the VMs, or workloads that run in VMs.
-**Availability Zones (AZs):** Are physicaly seperated zones within an Azure region. Each supported region contains 3 AZs. Azure services that support AZs fall into two categories:
  - **Zonal services:** A resource is pinned to a specific zone (e.g. IP adreesses).
  - **Zone-redundant services:** Azure replicates the resource automitically across zones (e.g. zone-redundant storage).

- **Availability sets:** Are Logical grouping of VMs that allows Azure to understand how your application is built to provide for redundancy and availability. An availability set is composed of 2 groupings that protect against hardware failures (Fault Domains) and allow updates to safely be applied (Update Domains):
  - **Fault Domains (FD):** Is a logical group of underlying hardware that share a common power source and network switch. As you create VMs within an availability set, the Azure platform automatically distributes your VMs across these FDs. This approach limits the impact of potential physical hardware failures, network outages, or power interruptions.
  - **Update Domains (UD):** Is a logical group of underlying hardware that can undergo maintenance or be rebooted at the same time. As you create VMs within an availability set, the Azure platform automatically distributes your VMs across these update domains. This approach ensures that at least one instance of your application always remains running as the Azure platform undergoes periodic maintenance.

- **VM scale sets:** Provides a group of load balanced VMs, which the number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease based on demand or a defined schedule. Load balancer task is distributeing incoming traffic among healthy VMs.

### Create some Azure VMs with Azure CLI:
You can create an Azure VM via Azure Portal, with Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, and many Infrastructure as Code (IaC) frameworks (e.g. ARM templates, Bicep, Terraform, etc.)

Create a Windows Server 2022 Data Center with Azure CLI:
```
az vm create \
    --resource-group rg-az204 \
    --locatio northeurope \
    --name testVM-az204 \
    --image Win2022Datacenter \
    --admin-username az204-user
```

Create a Ubuntu Linux with Azure CLI:
```
az vm create \
    --resource-group rg-az204 \
    --name vm-testUbuntu \
    --image UbuntuLTS \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --admin-username vm-testuser
```


## Create and deploy Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates
Azure ARM is the deployment and management service for provisioning, updating, deleting, and managing Azure resources in a subscription.

Azure ARM template is a JSON based template, which you can create and manage any kind of resources in azure in a declarative and automation way, rathar than manuel via Portal.
